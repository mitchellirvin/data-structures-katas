# List
Lists are a very common data structure, and provide the behavior you'd pretty much expect of a list of things. Lists 
maintain order according to how an element is inserted, and they allow you to check what element exists at a given 
position. You can remove elements at a given position, and check if the list contains a given element.

Implement your own array based resizable list (generically typed), named <YourName>ArrayList. 
<YourName>ArrayList will use an array to contain the underlying elements in <YourName>ArrayList.

Start by renaming `YourNameArrayList` to include your actual name. Mine would be `MitchArrayList`. 
Be sure to use the refactoring tool in your IDE, so that it is renamed everywhere.
`YourNameArrayList` implements our own `ArrayList` interface. This interface defines the method you'll need to 
implement in order to successfully pass the test cases in `ArrayListTest`.
